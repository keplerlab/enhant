# Basics

enhan(t) is an open source toolkit which enables you to enhance the web experience of existing video conferencing solutions like Zoom, MS Teams and Jitsi. It allows normal users to get an enhanced meeting experience by allowing one to bookmark moments, capture screenshots and take notes and view them in context with the meeting recording. It also enables power users to get NLP (Natural Language Processing) powered meeting metrics like engagement and sentiment. Moreover, it can provide extract questions which were asked during the meeting and when.

# Etymology

enhan(t) = **enh**anced + **an**alytics + **(t)**oolkit

# Features

1. Bookmark moments (to mark an important part of the meeting along with transcript)
1. Capture screenshots (to take a timestamped screenshot of the tab)
1. Take notes (to take manual notes along with when it was taken)
1. Download meeting data (which contains above mentioned bookmarks, screenshots and notes along with meeting transcript)
1. Power mode
    1. Engagement metrics
    1. Sentiment metrics
    1. Extract interrogatives (find what questions were asked during the meeting and when)
1. Get host side transcription (via microphone) in the Basic mode and both host and guest side transcription (via tab audio) in the Power mode (with the companion docker compose application)
1. View meeting data in a comprehensive dashboard

# Parts of enhan(t)
* Chrome extension
* Transcription Service and CLI
* enhan(t) meeting data viewer

## Chrome Extension
Then enhan(t) Chrome extension is the minimum requirement to get started with enhan(t) in a meaningful way.  It allows basic users to enhance the meetings conducted in Zoom, MS Teams or Jitsi on the Chrome browser. It enables users to:
* Bookmark moments (capture the timestamp of the moment along with the last <few> seconds of host side transcription)
* Capture screenshots (take the screenshot of the visible tab area along with the timestamp)
* Take notes (take manual notes along with timestamp)
* Transcript the host side of the conversation (from the microphone)
* Download meeting data zip file which contains all the above data

The extension can provide more data if used in Power mode alongside the companion transcription service. Once the setup is done, Docker application run and the Power mode is enabled in the extension settings, the extension will now be able to:
* Transcript both the host side (via microphone) and guest side (via tab audio) of the conversation
* Bookmarking moment with the transcription of the last <few> seconds of both side of the conversation
* Meeting metrics like engagement and sentiment and the questions asked during the meeting, can be extracted by processing the meeting data zip file using the CLI.


# Running Enhant

1. Clone repo 
```
git clone https://github.com/keplerlab/enhant.git
```

#### On **Windows** to prevent line ending issues clone using this command instead
```
git clone  https://github.com/keplerlab/enhant.git --config core.autocrlf=false
```



2. Start Docker containers:

```
cd /path/to/enhant-repo/
docker-compose up
```
If you want to use Google cloud use this instance
```
cd /path/to/enhant-repo/
docker-compose -f docker-compose-google-cloud.yml  up
```

3. Invoke cli for input zip file from plugin (input.zip in example below):

```
cd /path/to/enhant-repo
docker-compose run cli
python enhant_cli_app analyze input.zip
```

# Add certificate for localhost dev

## Install mkcert utility 

### macOS

On macOS, use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```
brew install mkcert
brew install nss # if you use Firefox
```

or [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/).

```
sudo port selfupdate
sudo port install mkcert
sudo port install nss # if you use Firefox
```

### Linux

On Linux, first install `certutil`.

```
sudo apt install libnss3-tools
    -or-
sudo yum install nss-tools
    -or-
sudo pacman -S nss
    -or-
sudo zypper install mozilla-nss-tools
```


### Windows

On Windows, use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org)

```
choco install mkcert
```

or use Scoop

```
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install mkcert
```

or build from source (requires Go 1.10+), or use [the pre-built binaries](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases).

If you're running into permission problems try running `mkcert` as an Administrator.


## Install local certificate authority using mkcert

```
$ mkcert -install
Created a new local CA at "/Users/filippo/Library/Application Support/mkcert" üí•
The local CA is now installed in the system trust store! ‚ö°Ô∏è
The local CA is now installed in the Firefox trust store (requires browser restart)! ü¶ä
```

## Create new certificate using mkcert 
```
$ cd certificates
$ mkcert -key-file key.pem -cert-file cert.pem localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
```
You should see following output with last command
```
Using the local CA at "/****/******/**/***/mkcert" ‚ú®

Created a new certificate valid for the following names üìú
 - "localhost"
 - "127.0.0.1"
 - "::1"
 
The certificate is at "cert.pem" and the key at "key.pem" ‚úÖ
```
