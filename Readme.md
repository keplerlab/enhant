## Parts of enhan(t)
* Chrome extension
* Transcription Service and CLI
* enhan(t) data viewer

### Chrome Extension
Then enhan(t) Chrome extension is the minimum requirement to get started with enhan(t) in a meaningful way.  It allows basic users to enhance the meetings conducted in Zoom, MS Teams or Jitsi on the Chrome browser. It enables users to:
* Bookmark moments (capture the timestamp of the moment along with the last 10 seconds of host side transcription)
* Capture screenshots (take the screenshot of the visible tab area along with the timestamp)
* Take notes (take manual notes along with timestamp)
* Transcript the host side of the conversation (from the microphone)
* Download meeting data zip file which contains all the above data

The extension can provide more data if used in Power mode alongside the companion transcription service. Once the setup is done, Docker application run and the Power mode is enabled in the extension settings, the extension will now be able to:
* Transcript both the host side (via microphone) and guest side (via tab audio) of the conversation
* Bookmarking moment with the transcription of the last 10 seconds of both side of the conversation
* Meeting metrics like engagement and sentiment and the questions asked during the meeting, can be extracted by processing the meeting data zip file using the CLI.

Created a new local CA at "/Users/filippo/Library/Application Support/mkcert" üí•
The local CA is now installed in the system trust store! ‚ö°Ô∏è
The local CA is now installed in the Firefox trust store (requires browser restart)! ü¶ä
```
