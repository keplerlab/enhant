Why use enhan(t)
----------------

Taking notes during a meeting has been a historically cumbersome task.
People take manual notes, take screenshots with a Win + Print Screen or
a Cmd + Shift + 3 or the likes, do a recording, etc.

But can this experience be enhanced?

That is what enhan(t) is all about. By leveraging existing web based
meeting solutions and providing a Chrome extension, the user is able to
now take a bookmark to mark an important moment, take screenshot of the tab 
with a single click and still provide the flexibility of taking manual notes
by hand-typing it or using their voice. All of these come
along with when these actions were taken, so that at a later point of
time, this data could be overlaid on top of a meeting recording to
provide a lot more context to the important parts of the meeting. This
is all apart from the full meeting transcript.

You can also annotate content during presentation to better convey your
point across by drawing over, highlighting content and adding text in
the page. You can take the screenshot to save it for future purpose.

Additionally, it provides Power users like customer support agents,
financial advisors and the likes more pertinent meeting metrics like
engagement and sentiment along with the questions which were asked
during the meeting.

enhan(t) therefore goes beyond the traditional note taking and provides
much more value by serving contextual data and meeting metrics.
