This guide describes a high level process of adding enhant to your
brainstorming or ideation process.
Imagine you have organized a brainstorming session to decide on the microsite
you would like to build to promote the launch or the device.

Download  and print templates beforehand. Download link:

Cut individual templates like this and paste on magnetic sheets or a cardboard.
Think of preparing a deck of components

Start placing your components as you are brainstorming.
for e.g. if the new phone has a very powerful camera
One idea may to show a slide show of features at the top.

Below it, may be you decide to few videos shot by the phone.

Now that you have reasonably complete page in place,
click the picture and generate a page.
Check out :ref:`idea2life_getting_started` for more details.

Continue with the brainstorming, may someone suggest to enable social sharing
and you place the social button on the page.
May be you really want to focus on images and remove  videos.
You continue to assemble/reassemble components
and generate pages at regular intervals.

After few options in place, you may want to filter it further.
Save the choosen ones with some meaningful names.
page default names are numbers and hence saving
them with proper names helps in searching them easily.

Go ahead and change the assets, styles or copy to make the chosen ones more
real. Check out :ref:`how_to_customize_pages_and_components` for more details.
If you are brainstorming workflows then connected the final page.
Check out :ref:`how_to_link_generated_pages` for more details.
