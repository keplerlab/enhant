needs to at least have the Chrome extension set up. The easiest way to
install it is via the Chrome store.

To install the enhan(t) extension:
----------------------------------

1. Navigate to Chrome Webstore <add link> via your Chrome browser.

   ‘enhan(t) Meeting Power Tool’ extension under the ‘Extensions’ jigsaw
   puzzle icon in your toolbar.

3. Pin the extension for easy access.

Using the enhan(t) extension:
-----------------------------

1. When you open a Zoom, MS Teams or Jitsi meeting, you will find the
   enhan(t) toolbar on the top right of your tab, with icons all grayed
   out and disabled. <Toolbar screenshot>

2. Click on the enhan(t) extension icon in the toolbar to activate the
   extension. The record icon would now be blue.

3. Hit the record icon to start enhan(t) and give permission to
   microphone if asked.

4. Now you can hit the:

   a. Bookmark icon to bookmark a moment

   b. Camera icon to capture the screenshot of the entire tab

   c. Document icon to take notes

5. Once the meeting is over, hit the animated record icon to stop
   enhan(t). A zip file containing the meeting data is downloaded in
   your default download location.
